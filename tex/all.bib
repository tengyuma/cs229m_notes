	abstract     = {Policy gradient (PG) methods are among the most effective methods in challenging reinforcement learning problems with large state and/or action spaces. However, little is known about even their most basic theoretical convergence properties, including: if and how fast they converge to a globally optimal solution (say with a sufficiently rich policy class); how they cope with approximation error due to using a restricted class of parametric policies; or their finite sample behavior. Such characterizations are important not only to compare these methods to their approximate value function counterparts (where such issues are relatively well understood, at least in the worst case), but also to help with more principled approaches to algorithm design. This work provides provable characterizations of computational, approximation, and sample size issues with regards to policy gradient methods in the context of discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We focus on both: 1) “tabular” policy parameterizations, where the optimal policy is contained in the class and where we show global convergence to the optimal policy, and 2) restricted policy classes, which may not contain the optimal policy and where we provide agnostic learning results. In the \emph{tabular setting}, our main results are: 1) convergence rate to global optimum for direct parameterization and projected gradient ascent 2) an asymptotic convergence to global optimum for softmax policy parameterization and PG; and a convergence rate with additional entropy regularization, and 3) dimension-free convergence to global optimum for softmax policy parameterization and Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) method with exact gradients. In \emph{function approximation}, we further analyze NPG with exact as well as inexact gradients under certain smoothness assumptions on the policy parameterization and establish rates of convergence in terms of the quality of the initial state distribution. One insight of this work is in formalizing how a favorable initial state distribution provides a means to circumvent worst-case exploration issues. Overall, these results place PG methods under a solid theoretical footing, analogous to the global convergence guarantees of iterative value function based algorithms.}

	abstract     = {The CUR matrix decomposition and the related Nyström method build low-rank approximations of data matrices by selecting a small number of representative rows and columns of the data. Here, we introduce novel \emphspectral gap error bounds that judiciously exploit the potentially rapid spectrum decay in the input matrix, a most common occurrence in machine learning and data analysis. Our error bounds are much tighter than existing ones for matrices with rapid spectrum decay, and they justify the use of a constant amount of oversampling relative to the rank parameter k, i.e, when the number of columns/rows is \ell=k+ O(1). We demonstrate our analysis on a novel deterministic algorithm, \emphStableCUR, which additionally eliminates a previously unrecognized source of potential instability in CUR decompositions. While our algorithm accepts any method of row and column selection, we implement it with a recent column selection scheme with strong singular value bounds. Empirical results on various classes of real world data matrices demonstrate that our algorithm is as efficient as and often outperforms competing algorithms.}

This problem is exacerbated in modern high-dimensional settings, where the problem dimension can grow with and possibly exceed the sample size. We consider the problem of robust estimation of sparse functionals, and provide a computationally and statistically efficient algorithm in the high-dimensional setting. Our theory identifies a unified set of deterministic conditions under which our algorithm guarantees accurate recovery. By further establishing that these deterministic conditions hold with high-probability for a wide range of statistical models, our theory applies to many problems of considerable interest including sparse mean and covariance estimation; sparse linear regression; and sparse generalized linear models. In certain settings, such as the detection and estimation of sparse principal components in the spiked covariance model, our general theory does not yield optimal sample complexity, and we provide a novel algorithm based on the same intuition which is able to take advantage of further structure of the problem to achieve nearly optimal rates.}

	abstract     = {We consider the \emphnoisy power method algorithm, which has wide applications in machine learning and statistics, especially those related to principal component analysis (PCA) under resource (communication, memory or privacy) constraints. Existing analysis of the noisy power method shows an unsatisfactory dependency over the “consecutive" spectral gap (\sigma_k-\sigma_k+1) of an input data matrix, which could be very small and hence limits the algorithm’s applicability. In this paper, we present a new analysis of the noisy power method that achieves improved gap dependency for both sample complexity and noise tolerance bounds. More specifically, we improve the dependency over (\sigma_k-\sigma_k+1) to dependency over (\sigma_k-\sigma_q+1), where q is an intermediate algorithm parameter and could be much larger than the target rank k. Our proofs are built upon a novel characterization of proximity between two subspaces that differ from canonical angle characterizations analyzed in previous works. Finally, we apply our improved bounds to distributed private PCA and memory-efficient streaming PCA and obtain bounds that are superior to existing results in the literature.}

The two main versions we consider are where the k parts need to be of equal-size, and where they must separate a set of k given terminals. We consider a common generalization of these two problems, and design for it an \$O(\backslash sqrt\{\backslash log n\backslash log k\})\$-approximation algorithm. This improves over an \$O(\backslash log\^{}2 n)\$ approximation for the second version, and roughly \$O(k\backslash log n)\$ approximation for the first version that follows from other previous work. We also give an improved O(1)-approximation algorithm for graphs that exclude any fixed minor. Our algorithm uses a new procedure for solving the Small-Set Expansion problem. In this problem, we are given a graph G and the goal is to find a non-empty set \$S\backslash subseteq V\$ of size \$|S| \backslash leq \backslash rho n\$ with minimum edge-expansion. We give an \$O(\backslash sqrt\{\backslash log\{n\}\backslash log\{(1/\backslash rho)\}\})\$ bicriteria approximation algorithm for the general case of Small-Set Expansion, and O(1) approximation algorithm for graphs that exclude any fixed minor.},

		As computation continues to move into the cloud, the computing platform

		Large portions of the hardware and software resources in these facilities

		must work in concert to efficiently deliver good levels of Internet

		service performance, something that can only be achieved by a holistic

		approach to their design and deployment. In other words, we must

		treat the datacenter itself as one massive warehouse-scale computer

		(WSC). We describe the architecture of WSCs, the main factors influencing

		their design, operation, and cost structure, and the characteristics

		of their software base. We hope it will be useful to architects and

		programmers of today's WSCs, as well as those of future many-core

		platforms which may one day implement the equivalent of today's WSCs

As linear-sized spectral sparsifiers of complete graphs are expanders, our sparsifiers of arbitrary graphs can be viewed as generalizations of expander graphs. In particular, we prove that for every \$d>1\$ and every undirected, weighted graph \$G=(V,E,w)\$ on \$n\$ vertices, there exists a weighted graph \$H=(V,F,\backslash tilde\{w\})\$ with at most \$\backslash ceil\{d(n-1)\}\$ edges such that for every \$x \backslash in \backslash R\^{}\{V\}\$, $\backslash$[ x\^{}\{T\}L\_\{G\}x $\backslash$leq x\^{}\{T\}L\_\{H\}x $\backslash$leq ($\backslash$frac\{d+1+2$\backslash$sqrt\{d\}\}\{d+1-2$\backslash$sqrt\{d\}\})$\backslash$cdot x\^{}\{T\}L\_\{G\}x $\backslash$] where \$L\_\{G\}\$ and \$L\_\{H\}\$ are the Laplacian matrices of \$G\$ and \$H\$, respectively. Thus, \$H\$ approximates \$G\$ spectrally at least as well as a Ramanujan expander with \$dn/2\$ edges approximates the complete graph. We give an elementary deterministic polynomial time algorithm for constructing \$H\$.},

The inequalities presented require knowledge only of the variance of the sum and the means and bounds of the component random variables. They are applicable when the number of component random variables is small and/or have different distributions. Figures show the improvement on existing inequalities.},

		{The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning

		over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments

		in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian

		methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream,

		while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing

		and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability

		of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development

		of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational

		Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels

		have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications.

		This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while

		providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition

		and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year

		PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous

		knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is

		assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear

		algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities

		would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained

		introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for

		courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal

		processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive

		support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400

		exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for

		a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while

		solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the

		publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material,

		and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest

		information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical

		aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include

		free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example

		data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant

		Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair

		in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow

		of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the

		Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural

		Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.}

		The problem of minimising a real scalar quantity (for example array

		A complex gradient operator is defined in the paper for this purpose

		and its use justified. Three examples of its application to array

		theory problems are given.

		In this paper, we develop a new method to sample from posterior distributions

		in hierarchical models without using Markov chain Monte Carlo. This method is

		generally applicable to high-dimensional models involving large data sets.

		Illustrative analysis exemplifies the ease with which one could implement our

		method, which results in independent samples from the posterior distributions

		of interest.

We prove convergence to a saddle-point with rate O(1/N) in finite dimensions for the complete class of problems. We further show accelerations of the proposed algorithm to yield improved rates on problems with some degree of smoothness. In particular we show that we can achieve O(1/N 2) convergence on problems, where the primal or the dual objective is uniformly convex, and we can show linear convergence, i.e. O($\omega$ N ) for some $\omega$∈(0,1), on smooth problems. The wide applicability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on several imaging problems such as image denoising, image deconvolution, image inpainting, motion estimation and multi-label image segmentation.},

		Support Vector Machines ({SVMs}) suffer from a widely recognized scalability

		problem in both memory use and computational time. To improve scalability,

		we have developed a parallel {SVM} algorithm ({PSVM}), which reduces

		memory use through performing a row-based, approximate matrix factorization,

		and which loads only essential data to each machine to perform parallel

		computation. Let n denote the number of training instances, p the

		reduced matrix dimension after factorization (p is significantly

		smaller than n), and m the number of machines. {PSVM} reduces the

		memory requirement from O(n2) to O(np=m), and improves computation

		time to O(np2=m). Empirical study shows {PSVM} to be effective. {PSVM}

	abstract     = {We introduce a new approach to computing an approximately maximum s-t flow in a capacitated, undirected graph. This flow is computed by solving a sequence of electrical flow problems. Each electrical flow is given by the solution of a system of linear equations in a Laplacian matrix, and thus may be approximately computed in nearly-linear time. Using this approach, we develop the fastest known algorithm for computing approximately maximum s-t flows. For a graph having n vertices and m edges, our algorithm computes a (1-$\backslash$epsilon)-approximately maximum s-t flow in time $\backslash$tilde\{O\}(mn\^{}\{1/3\} $\backslash$epsilon\^{}\{-11/3\}). A dual version of our approach computes a (1+$\backslash$epsilon)-approximately minimum s-t cut in time $\backslash$tilde\{O\}(m+n\^{}\{4/3\}$\backslash$eps\^{}\{-8/3\}), which is the fastest known algorithm for this problem as well. Previously, the best dependence on m and n was achieved by the algorithm of Goldberg and Rao (J. ACM 1998), which can be used to compute approximately maximum s-t flows in time $\backslash$tilde\{O\}(m$\backslash$sqrt\{n\}$\backslash$epsilon\^{}\{-1\}), and approximately minimum s-t cuts in time $\backslash$tilde\{O\}(m+n\^{}\{3/2\}$\backslash$epsilon\^{}\{-3\}).},

In this work we introduce a new method in this class with a theoretical convergence rate four times faster than existing methods, for sums with sufficiently many terms. This method is also amendable to a sampling without replacement scheme that in practice gives further speed-ups. We give empirical results showing state of the art performance. 1},

SAGA improves on the theory behind SAG and SVRG, with better theoretical convergence rates, and has support for composite objectives where a proximal operator is used on the regulariser. Unlike SDCA, SAGA supports non-strongly convex problems directly, and is adaptive to any inherent strong convexity of the problem.

However, in the age of web-scale prediction problems, it is increasingly common to encounter situations where a single processor cannot keep up with the high rate at which inputs arrive. In this work, we present the $\backslash$emph\{distributed mini-batch\} algorithm, a method of converting many serial gradient-based online prediction algorithms into distributed algorithms. We prove a regret bound for this method that is asymptotically optimal for smooth convex loss functions and stochastic inputs. Moreover, our analysis explicitly takes into account communication latencies between nodes in the distributed environment. We show how our method can be used to solve the closely-related distributed stochastic optimization problem, achieving an asymptotically linear speed-up over multiple processors. Finally, we demonstrate the merits of our approach on a web-scale online prediction problem.},

	abstract     = {Policy evaluation is concerned with estimating the value function that predicts long-term values of states under a given policy. It is a crucial step in many reinforcement-learning algorithms. In this paper, we focus on policy evaluation with linear function approximation over a fixed dataset. We first transform the empirical policy evaluation problem into a (quadratic) convex-concave saddle-point problem, and then present a primal-dual batch gradient method, as well as two stochastic variance reduction methods for solving the problem. These algorithms scale linearly in both sample size and feature dimension. Moreover, they achieve linear convergence even when the saddle-point problem has only strong concavity in the dual variables but no strong convexity in the primal variables. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.}

We prove that if the coupling matrix $A$ has full column rank, the vanilla primal-dual gradient method can achieve linear convergence even if $f$ is not strongly convex. Our result generalizes previous work which either requires $f$ and $g$ to be quadratic functions or requires proximal mappings for both $f$ and $g$. We adopt a novel analysis technique that in each iteration uses a "ghost" update as a reference, and show that the iterates in the primal-dual gradient method converge to this "ghost" sequence. Using the same technique we further give an analysis for the primal-dual stochastic variance reduced gradient method for convex-concave saddle point problems with a finite-sum structure.}

This result shows that the large-deviation behavior of a martingale is controlled by the predictable quadratic variation and a uniform upper bound for the martingale difference sequence. Oliveira has recently established a natural extension of Freedman's inequality that provides tail bounds for the maximum singular value of a matrix-valued martingale. This note describes a different proof of the matrix Freedman inequality that depends on a deep theorem of Lieb from matrix analysis. This argument delivers sharp constants in the matrix Freedman inequality, and it also yields tail bounds for other types of matrix martingales. The new techniques are adapted from recent work by the present author.}

	abstract     = {The parameters of temporal models, such as dynamic Bayesian networks, may be modelled in a Bayesian context as static or atemporal variables that influence transition probabilities at every time step. Particle filters fail for models that include such variables, while methods that use Gibbs sampling of parameter variables may incur a per-sample cost that grows linearly with the length of the observation sequence. Storvik devised a method for incremental computation of exact sufficient statistics that, for some cases, reduces the per-sample cost to a constant. In this paper, we demonstrate a connection between Storvik's filter and a Kalman filter in parameter space and establish more general conditions under which Storvik's filter works. Drawing on an analogy to the extended Kalman filter, we develop and analyze, both theoretically and experimentally, a Taylor approximation to the parameter posterior that allows Storvik's method to be applied to a broader class of models. Our experiments on both synthetic examples and real applications show improvement over existing methods.}

		This paper presents studies of the coordination of voluntary human

		arm movements. A mathematical model is formulated which is shown

		to predict both the qualitative features and the quantitative details

		observed experimentally in planar, multijoint arm movements. Coordination

		is modeled mathematically by defining an objective function, a measure

		of performance for any possible movement. The unique trajectory which

		yields the best performance is determined using dynamic optimization

		theory. In the work presented here, the objective function is the

		square of the magnitude of jerk (rate of change of acceleration)

		of the hand integrated over the entire movement. This is equivalent

		to assuming that a major goal of motor coordination is the production

		of the smoothest possible movement of the hand. Experimental observations

		of human subjects performing voluntary unconstrained movements in

		a horizontal plane are presented. They confirm the following predictions

		of the mathematical model: unconstrained point-to-point motions are

		approximately straight with bell-shaped tangential velocity profiles;

		curved motions (through an intermediate point or around an obstacle)

		have portions of low curvature joined by portions of high curvature;

		at points of high curvature, the tangential velocity is reduced;

		the durations of the low-curvature portions are approximately equal.

		The theoretical analysis is based solely on the kinematics of movement

		independent of the dynamics of the musculoskeletal system and is

		successful only when formulated in terms of the motion of the hand

		in extracorporal space. The implications with respect to movement

		organization are discussed.

Algorithms based on regression have shown promising empirical success, but theoretical guarantees have remained elusive except in special cases. We provide the first universal and optimal reduction from contextual bandits to online regression. We show how to transform any oracle for online regression with a given value function class into an algorithm for contextual bandits with the induced policy class, with no overhead in runtime or memory requirements. We characterize the minimax rates for contextual bandits with general, potentially nonparametric function classes, and show that our algorithm is minimax optimal whenever the oracle obtains the optimal rate for regression. Compared to previous results, our algorithm requires no distributional assumptions beyond realizability, and works even when contexts are chosen adversarially.}

	abstract     = {We develop a family of accelerated stochastic algorithms that minimize sums of convex functions. Our algorithms improve upon the fastest running time for empirical risk minimization (ERM), and in particular linear least-squares regression, across a wide range of problem settings. To achieve this, we establish a framework based on the classical proximal point algorithm. Namely, we provide several algorithms that reduce the minimization of a strongly convex function to approximate minimizations of regularizations of the function. Using these results, we accelerate recent fast stochastic algorithms in a black-box fashion. Empirically, we demonstrate that the resulting algorithms exhibit notions of stability that are advantageous in practice. Both in theory and in practice, the provided algorithms reap the computational benefits of adding a large strongly convex regularization term, without incurring a corresponding bias to the original problem.},

		Classification is an important data analysis tool that uses a model

		algorithms. Concept drifts and skewed distributions, two common properties

		of data stream applications, make the task of learning in streams

		difficult. The authors aim to develop a new approach to classify

		skewed data streams that uses an ensemble of models to match the

		distribution over under-samples of negatives and repeated samples

		of positives.

		Linear systems have been used extensively in engineering to model

		and control the behavior of dynamical systems. In this note, we present

		the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating the parameters

		of linear systems (Shumway and Stoffer, 1982). We also point out

		the relationship between linear dynamical systems, factor analysis,

		and hidden Markov models. Introduction

		The goal of this note is to introduce the EM algorithm for estimating

		the parameters of linear dynamical systems...

This book provides an up-to-date overview of numerical methods for computing special functions and discusses when to use these methods depending on the function and the range of parameters. Not only are standard and simple parameter domains considered, but methods valid for large and complex parameters are described as well. The first part of the book (basic methods) covers convergent and divergent series, Chebyshev expansions, numerical quadrature, and recurrence relations. Its focus is on the computation of special functions; however, it is suitable for general numerical courses. Pseudoalgorithms are given to help students write their own algorithms. In addition to these basic tools, the authors discuss other useful and efficient methods, such as methods for computing zeros of special functions, uniform asymptotic expansions, Pad{\'{e}} approximations, and sequence transformations. The book also provides specific algorithms for computing several special functions (like Airy functions and parabolic cylinder functions, among others).},

		This book provides a synthesis of concepts and materials that ordinarily

		appear separately in time series and econometrics literature, presenting

		a comprehensive review of both theoretical and applied concepts.

		Perhaps the most novel feature of the book is its use of Kalman filtering

		together with econometric and time series methodology. From a technical

		point of view, state space models and the Kalman filter play a key

		role in the statistical treatment of structural time series models.

		This technique was originally developed in control engineering but

		is becoming increasingly important in economics and operations research.

		The book is primarily concerned with modeling economic and social

		time series and with addressing the special problems that the treatment

		of such series pose.

		During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation

		and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data

		in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing.

		The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development

		of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such

		as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics.

		Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed

		with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas

		in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach

		is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics.

		Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It

		should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested

		in data mining in science or industry.

		The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction)

		to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks,

		support vector machines, classification trees and boosting--the first

		comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.

		Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors

		of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers

		in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive

		models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much

		of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal

		curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author

		of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman

		is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS,

		and projection pursuit.

		FROM THE REVIEWS:

		TECHNOMETRICS "[This] is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates

		on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use

		them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As

		a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably

		be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."

	abstract     = {In several online prediction problems of recent interest the comparison class is composed of matrices with bounded entries. For example, in the online max-cut problem, the comparison class is matrices which represent cuts of a given graph and in online gambling the comparison class is matrices which represent permutations over n teams. Another important example is online collaborative filtering in which a widely used comparison class is the set of matrices with a small trace norm. In this paper we isolate a property of matrices, which we call (beta,tau)-decomposability, and derive an efficient online learning algorithm, that enjoys a regret bound of O*(sqrt(beta tau T)) for all problems in which the comparison class is composed of (beta,tau)-decomposable matrices. By analyzing the decomposability of cut matrices, triangular matrices, and low trace-norm matrices, we derive near optimal regret bounds for online max-cut, online gambling, and online collaborative filtering. In particular, this resolves (in the affirmative) an open problem posed by Abernethy (2010); Kleinberg et al (2010). Finally, we derive lower bounds for the three problems and show that our upper bounds are optimal up to logarithmic factors. In particular, our lower bound for the online collaborative filtering problem resolves another open problem posed by Shamir and Srebro (2011).},

		{A comprehensive introduction to ICA for students and practitioners<br>

		Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is one of the most exciting

		new topics in fields such as neural networks, advanced statistics,

		and signal processing. This is the first book to provide a comprehensive

		introduction to this new technique complete with the fundamental

		mathematical background needed to understand and utilize it. It offers

		a general overview of the basics of ICA, important solutions and

		algorithms, and in-depth coverage of new applications in image processing,

		telecommunications, audio signal processing, and more.<br> Independent

		Component Analysis is divided into four sections that cover:<br>

		* General mathematical concepts utilized in the book<br> * The basic

		ICA model and its solution<br> * Various extensions of the basic

		ICA model<br> * Real-world applications for ICA models<br> Authors

		Hyvarinen, Karhunen, and Oja are well known for their contributions

		to the development of ICA and here cover all the relevant theory,

		new algorithms, and applications in various fields. Researchers,

		students, and practitioners from a variety of disciplines will find

		this accessible volume both helpful and informative.}

In each transaction, the seller offers a price between 0 and 1, and the buyer decides whether or not to buy, by comparing the offered price to his privately-held valuation for the good. The price offered to a given buyer may be influenced by the outcomes of prior transactions, but each individual buyer participates only once. In this setting, what is the value of knowing the demand curve? In other words, how much revenue can an uninformed seller expect to obtain, relative to a seller with prior information about the buyers' valuations? The answer depends on how the buyers' valuations are modeled. We analyze three cases - identical, random, and worst-case valuations - in each case deriving upper and lower bounds which match within a sublogarithmic factor.},

	abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a new framework for approximately solving flow problems in capacitated, undirected graphs and apply it to provide asymptotically faster algorithms for the maximum \$s\$-\$t\$ flow and maximum concurrent multicommodity flow problems. For graphs with \$n\$ vertices and \$m\$ edges, it allows us to find an \$\backslash epsilon\$-approximate maximum \$s\$-\$t\$ flow in time \$O(m\^{}\{1+o(1)\}\backslash epsilon\^{}\{-2\})\$, improving on the previous best bound of \$\backslash tilde\{O\}(mn\^{}\{1/3\} poly(1/\backslash epsilon))\$. Applying the same framework in the multicommodity setting solves a maximum concurrent multicommodity flow problem with \$k\$ commodities in \$O(m\^{}\{1+o(1)\}\backslash epsilon\^{}\{-2\}k\^{}2)\$ time, improving on the existing bound of \$\backslash tilde\{O\}(m\^{}\{4/3\} poly(k,\backslash epsilon\^{}\{-1\})\$. Our algorithms utilize several new technical tools that we believe may be of independent interest: - We give a non-Euclidean generalization of gradient descent and provide bounds on its performance. Using this, we show how to reduce approximate maximum flow and maximum concurrent flow to the efficient construction of oblivious routings with a low competitive ratio. - We define and provide an efficient construction of a new type of flow sparsifier. In addition to providing the standard properties of a cut sparsifier our construction allows for flows in the sparse graph to be routed (very efficiently) in the original graph with low congestion. - We give the first almost-linear-time construction of an \$O(m\^{}\{o(1)\})\$-competitive oblivious routing scheme. No previous such algorithm ran in time better than \$\backslash tilde\{\{\backslash Omega\}\}(mn)\$. We also note that independently Jonah Sherman produced an almost linear time algorithm for maximum flow and we thank him for coordinating submissions.},

		Modern applications such as Internet traffic, telecommunication records,

		and large-scale social networks generate massive amounts of data

		with multiple aspects and high dimensionalities. Tensors (i.e., multi-way

		arrays) provide a natural representation for such data. Consequently,

		tensor decompositions such as Tucker become important tools for summarization

		and analysis. One major challenge is how to deal with high-dimensional,

		sparse data. In other words, how do we compute decompositions of

		tensors where most of the entries of the tensor are zero. Specialized

		techniques are needed for computing the Tucker decompositions for

		sparse tensors because standard algorithms do not account for the

		sparsity of the data. As a result, a surprising phenomenon is observed

		by practitioners: Despite the fact that there is enough memory to

		store both the input tensors and the factorized output tensors, memory

		overflows occur during the tensor factorization process. To address

		this intermediate blowup problem, we propose Memory-Efficient Tucker

		(MET). Based on the available memory, MET adaptively selects the

		right execution strategy during the decomposition. We provide quantitative

		and qualitative evaluation of MET on real tensors. It achieves over

		1000X space reduction without sacrificing speed; it also allows us

		to work with much larger tensors that were too big to handle before.

		Finally, we demonstrate a data mining case-study using MET.

	abstract     = {Computational learning theory studies mathematical models that allow one to formally analyze and compare the performance of supervised-learning algorithms such as their sample complexity. While existing models such as PAC ( Probably Approximately Correct ) have played an influential role in understanding the nature of supervised learning, they have not been as successful in reinforcement learning (RL). Here, the fundamental barrier is the need for active exploration in sequential decision problems. An RL agent tries to maximize long-term utility by exploiting its knowledge about the problem, but this knowledge has to be acquired by the agent itself through exploring the problem that may reduce short-term utility. The need for active exploration is common in many problems in daily life, engineering, and sciences. For example, a Backgammon program strives to take good moves to maximize the probability of winning a game, but sometimes it may try novel and possibly harmful moves to discover how the opponent reacts in the hope of discovering a better game-playing strategy. It has been known since the early days of RL that a good tradeoff between exploration and exploitation is critical for the agent to learn fast ( i.e. , to reach near-optimal strategies with a small sample complexity ), but a general theoretical analysis of this tradeoff remained open until recently. In this dissertation, we introduce a novel computational learning model called KWIK ( Knows What It Knows ) that is designed particularly for its utility in analyzing learning problems like RL where active exploration can impact the training data the learner is exposed to. My thesis is that the KWIK learning model provides a flexible, modularized, and unifying way for creating and analyzing reinforcement-learning algorithms with provably efficient exploration. In particular, we show how the KWIK perspective can be used to unify the analysis of existing RL algorithms with polynomial sample complexity. It also facilitates the development of new algorithms with smaller sample complexity, which have demonstrated empirically faster learning speed in real-world problems. Furthermore, we provide an improved, matching sample complexity lower bound, which suggests the optimality (in a sense) of one of the KWIK-based algorithms known as delayed Q-learning .}

We first prove equivalence theorems that show all of these algorithms are instantiations of a general FTRL update. This provides theoretical insight on previous experimental observations. In particular, even though the FOBOS composite mirror descent algorithm handles L1 regularization explicitly, it has been observed that RDA is even more effective at producing sparsity. Our results demonstrate that FOBOS uses subgradient approximations to the L1 penalty from previous rounds, leading to less sparsity than RDA, which handles the cumulative penalty in closed form. The FTRL-Proximal algorithm can be seen as a hybrid of these two, and outperforms both on a large, real-world dataset. Our second contribution is a unified analysis which produces regret bounds that match (up to logarithmic terms) or improve the best previously known bounds. This analysis also extends these algorithms in two important ways: we support a more general type of composite objective and we analyze implicit updates, which replace the subgradient approximation of the current loss function with an exact optimization.},

This is in contrast to previous algorithms that use a fixed regularization function such as L2-squared, and modify it only via a single time-dependent parameter. Our algorithm's regret bounds are worst-case optimal, and for certain realistic classes of loss functions they are much better than existing bounds. These bounds are problem-dependent, which means they can exploit the structure of the actual problem instance. Critically, however, our algorithm does not need to know this structure in advance. Rather, we prove competitive guarantees that show the algorithm provides a bound within a constant factor of the best possible bound (of a certain functional form) in hindsight.},

	abstract     = {We study the generalization errors of \emph{non-convex} regularized ERM procedures using Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). Two theories are proposed with non-asymptotic discrete-time analysis, using stability and PAC-Bayesian theory respectively. The stability-based theory obtains a bound of $O\left(\frac{1}{n}L\sqrt{\beta T_N}\right)$, where $L$ is Lipschitz parameter, $\beta$ is inverse temperature, and $T_N$ is the sum of step sizes. For PAC-Bayesian theory, though the bound has a slower $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ rate, the contribution of each step decays exponentially through time, and the uniform Lipschitz constant is also replaced by actual norms of gradients along the optimization trajectory. Our bounds have reasonable dependence on aggregated step sizes, and do not explicitly depend on dimensions, norms or other capacity measures of the parameter. The bounds characterize how the noises in the algorithm itself controls the statistical learning behavior in non-convex problems, without uniform convergence in the hypothesis space, which sheds light on the effect of training algorithms on the generalization error for deep neural networks.}

Besides other advantages, this useful feature provides the methods with a reliable stopping criterion. The proposed schemes differ from the classical approaches (divergent series methods, mirror descent methods) by presence of two control sequences. The first sequence is responsible for aggregating the support functions in the dual space, and the second one establishes a dynamically updated scale between the primal and dual spaces. This additional flexi- bility allows to guarantee a boundedness of the sequence of primal test points even in the case of unbounded feasible set (however, we always assume the uniform bounded- ness of subgradients).We present the variants of subgradient schemes for nonsmooth convex minimization, minimax problems, saddle point problems, variational inequali- ties, and stochastic optimization. In all situations our methods are proved to be optimal from the view point of worst-case black-box lower complexity bounds.},

Hence, we propose to apply an optimization technique based on random partial update of decision variables. For these methods, we prove the global estimates for the rate of convergence. Surprisingly, for certain classes of objective functions, our results are better than the standard worst-case bounds for deterministic algorithms. We present constrained and unconstrained versions of the method and its accelerated variant. Our numerical test confirms a high efficiency of this technique on problems of very big size.

We prove our results by arguing that SGM is algorithmically stable in the sense of Bousquet and Elisseeff. Our analysis only employs elementary tools from convex and continuous optimization. We derive stability bounds for both convex and non-convex optimization under standard Lipschitz and smoothness assumptions. Applying our results to the convex case, we provide new insights for why multiple epochs of stochastic gradient methods generalize well in practice. In the non-convex case, we give a new interpretation of common practices in neural networks, and formally show that popular techniques for training large deep models are indeed stability-promoting. Our findings conceptually underscore the importance of reducing training time beyond its obvious benefit.}

	abstract     = {Given \$n\$ points in a \$d\$ dimensional Euclidean space, the Minimum Enclosing Ball (MEB) problem is to find the ball with the smallest radius which contains all \$n\$ points. We give a \$O(nd\backslash Qcal/\backslash sqrt\{\backslash epsilon\})\$ approximation algorithm for producing an enclosing ball whose radius is at most \$\backslash epsilon\$ away from the optimum (where \$\backslash Qcal\$ is an upper bound on the norm of the points). This improves existing results using $\backslash$emph\{coresets\}, which yield a \$O(nd/\backslash epsilon)\$ greedy algorithm. Finding the Minimum Enclosing Convex Polytope (MECP) is a related problem wherein a convex polytope of a fixed shape is given and the aim is to find the smallest magnification of the polytope which encloses the given points. For this problem we present a \$O(mnd\backslash Qcal/\backslash epsilon)\$ approximation algorithm, where \$m\$ is the number of faces of the polytope. Our algorithms borrow heavily from convex duality and recently developed techniques in non-smooth optimization, and are in contrast with existing methods which rely on geometric arguments. In particular, we specialize the excessive gap framework of $\backslash$citet\{Nesterov05a\} to obtain our results.},

	abstract     = {We propose the stochastic average gradient (SAG) method for optimizing the sum of a finite number of smooth convex functions. Like stochastic gradient (SG) methods, the SAG method's iteration cost is independent of the number of terms in the sum. However, by incorporating a memory of previous gradient values the SAG method achieves a faster convergence rate than black-box SG methods. The convergence rate is improved from O(1/k\^{}\{1/2\}) to O(1/k) in general, and when the sum is strongly-convex the convergence rate is improved from the sub-linear O(1/k) to a linear convergence rate of the form O(p\^{}k) for p < 1. Further, in many cases the convergence rate of the new method is also faster than black-box deterministic gradient methods, in terms of the number of gradient evaluations. Numerical experiments indicate that the new algorithm often dramatically outperforms existing SG and deterministic gradient methods, and that the performance may be further improved through the use of non-uniform sampling strategies.},

This paper considers an extension of SDCA under the mini-batch setting that is often used in practice. Our main contribution is to introduce an accelerated mini-batch version of SDCA and prove a fast convergence rate for this method. We discuss an implementation of our method over a parallel computing system, and compare the results to both the vanilla stochastic dual coordinate ascent and to the accelerated deterministic gradient descent method of $\backslash$cite\{nesterov2007gradient\}.},

	abstract     = {Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is one of the simplest and most popular stochastic optimization methods. While it has already been theoretically studied for decades, the classical analysis usually required non-trivial smoothness assumptions, which do not apply to many modern applications of SGD with non-smooth objective functions such as support vector machines. In this paper, we investigate the performance of SGD without such smoothness assumptions, as well as a running average scheme to convert the SGD iterates to a solution with optimal optimization accuracy. In this framework, we prove that after T rounds, the suboptimality of the last SGD iterate scales as O(log(T)/$\backslash$sqrt\{T\}) for non-smooth convex objective functions, and O(log(T)/T) in the non-smooth strongly convex case. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first bounds of this kind, and almost match the minimax-optimal rates obtainable by appropriate averaging schemes. We also propose a new and simple averaging scheme, which not only attains optimal rates, but can also be easily computed on-the-fly (in contrast, the suffix averaging scheme proposed in Rakhlin et al. (2011) is not as simple to implement). Finally, we provide some experimental illustrations.},

Results of this sort have found applications in many different areas, including sparsifying graphs. In this paper we consider the more general problem of sparsifying sums of positive semidefinite matrices that have arbitrary rank. We give several algorithms for solving this problem. The first algorithm is based on the method of Batson, Spielman and Srivastava (2009). The second algorithm is based on the matrix multiplicative weights update method of Arora and Kale (2007). We also highlight an interesting connection between these two algorithms. Our algorithms have numerous applications. We show how they can be used to construct graph sparsifiers with auxiliary constraints, sparsifiers of hypergraphs, and sparse solutions to semidefinite programs.},

	abstract     = {We study the design of local algorithms for massive graphs. A local algorithm is one that finds a solution containing or near a given vertex without looking at the whole graph. We present a local clustering algorithm. Our algorithm finds a good cluster--a subset of vertices whose internal connections are significantly richer than its external connections--near a given vertex. The running time of our algorithm, when it finds a non-empty local cluster, is nearly linear in the size of the cluster it outputs. Our clustering algorithm could be a useful primitive for handling massive graphs, such as social networks and web-graphs. As an application of this clustering algorithm, we present a partitioning algorithm that finds an approximate sparsest cut with nearly optimal balance. Our algorithm takes time nearly linear in the number edges of the graph. Using the partitioning algorithm of this paper, we have designed a nearly-linear time algorithm for constructing spectral sparsifiers of graphs, which we in turn use in a nearly-linear time algorithm for solving linear systems in symmetric, diagonally-dominant matrices. The linear system solver also leads to a nearly linear-time algorithm for approximating the second-smallest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of the Laplacian matrix of a graph. These other results are presented in two companion papers.},

This is equivalent to saying that the Laplacian of the sparsifier is a good preconditioner for the Laplacian of the original. We prove that every graph has a spectral sparsifier of nearly linear size. Moreover, we present an algorithm that produces spectral sparsifiers in time \$\backslash softO\{m\}\$, where \$m\$ is the number of edges in the original graph. This construction is a key component of a nearly-linear time algorithm for solving linear equations in diagonally-dominant matrcies. Our sparsification algorithm makes use of a nearly-linear time algorithm for graph partitioning that satisfies a strong guarantee: if the partition it outputs is very unbalanced, then the larger part is contained in a subgraph of high conductance.},

By applying this algorithm inside the inverse power method, we compute approximate Fiedler vectors in a similar amount of time. The algorithm applies subgraph preconditioners in a recursive fashion. These preconditioners improve upon the subgraph preconditioners first introduced by Vaidya (1990). For any symmetric, weakly diagonally-dominant matrix A with non-positive off-diagonal entries and \$k \backslash geq 1\$, we construct in time \$O (m \backslash log\^{}\{c\} n)\$ a preconditioner B of A with at most \$2 (n - 1) + O ((m/k) \backslash log\^{}\{39\} n)\$ nonzero off-diagonal entries such that the finite generalized condition number \$\backslash kappa\_\{f\} (A,B)\$ is at most k, for some other constant c. In the special case when the nonzero structure of the matrix is planar the corresponding linear system solver runs in expected time \$ O (n \backslash log\^{}\{2\} n + n \backslash log n \backslash \backslash log \backslash log n \backslash \backslash log (1/\backslash epsilon))\$. We hope that our introduction of algorithms of low asymptotic complexity will lead to the development of algorithms that are also fast in practice.},

		Data stream values are often associated with multiple aspects. For

		example, each value from environmental sensors may have an associated

		type (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc) as well as location. Aside

		from timestamp, type and location are the two additional aspects.

		How to model such streams? How to simultaneously find patterns within

		and across the multiple aspects? How to do it incrementally in a

		streaming fashion? In this paper, all these problems are addressed

		through a general data model, tensor streams, and an effective algorithmic

		framework, window-based tensor analysis (WTA). Two variations of

		WTA, independent- window tensor analysis (IW) and moving-window tensor

		analysis (MW), are presented and evaluated extensively on real datasets.

		Finally, we illustrate one important application, multi-aspect correlation

		analysis (MACA), which uses WTA and we demonstrate its effectiveness

		on an environmental monitoring application.

		How do we find patterns in author-keyword associations, evolving over

		time Or in data cubes (tensors), with product-branchcustomer sales

		information And more generally, how to summarize high-order data

		cubes (tensors) How to incrementally update these patterns over time

		Matrix decompositions, like principal component analysis (PCA) and

		variants, are invaluable tools for mining, dimensionality reduction,

		feature selection, rule identification in numerous settings like

		streaming data, text, graphs, social networks, and many more settings.

		However, they have only two orders (i.e., matrices, like author and

		keyword in the previous example). We propose to envision such higher-order

		data as tensors, and tap the vast literature on the topic. However,

		these methods do not necessarily scale up, let alone operate on semi-infinite

		streams. Thus, we introduce a general framework, incremental tensor

		analysis (ITA), which efficiently computes a compact summary for

		high-order and high-dimensional data, and also reveals the hidden

		correlations. Three variants of ITA are presented: (1) dynamic tensor

		analysis (DTA); (2) streaming tensor analysis (STA); and (3) window-based

		tensor analysis (WTA). In paricular, we explore several fundamental

		design trade-offs such as space efficiency, computational cost, approximation

		accuracy, time dependency, and model complexity. We implement all

		our methods and apply them in several real settings, such as network

		anomaly detection, multiway latent semantic indexing on citation

		networks, and correlation study on sensor measurements. Our empirical

		studies show that the proposed methods are fast and accurate and

		that they find interesting patterns and outliers on the real datasets.

In addition, several strategies are available for constructing hybrid algorithms. This paper outlines some of the basic methods and strategies and discusses some related theoretical and practical issues. On the theoretical side, results from the theory of general state space Markov chains can be used to obtain convergence rates, laws of large numbers and central limit theorems for estimates obtained from Markov chain methods. These theoretical results can be used to guide the construction of more efficient algorithms. For the practical use of Markov chain methods, standard simulation methodology provides several variance reduction techniques and also give guidance on the choice of sample size and allocation.},

In many of these theoretical studies, the concept of covering numbers played an important role. It is thus useful to study covering numbers for linear function classes. In this paper, we investigate two closely related methods to derive upper bounds on these covering numbers. The first method, already employed in some earlier studies, relies on the so-called Maurey's lemma; the second method uses techniques from the mistake bound framework in online learning. We compare results from these two methods, as well as their consequences in some learning formulations.},

	abstract     = {
		In this paper, we study trajectory planning and control in voluntary,

		human arm movements. When a hand is moved to a target, the central

		nervous system must select one specific trajectory among an infinite

		number of possible trajectories that lead to the target position.

		First, we discuss what criterion is adopted for trajectory determination.

		Several researchers measured the hand trajectories of skilled movements

		and found common invariant features. For example, when moving the

		hand between a pair of targets, subjects tended to generate roughly

		straight hand paths with bell-shaped speed profiles. On the basis

		of these observations and dynamic optimization theory, we propose

		a mathematical model which accounts for formation of hand trajectories.

		This model is formulated by defining an objective function, a measure

		of performance for any possible movement: square of the rate of change

		of torque integrated over the entire movement. That is, the objective

		function CT is defined as follows: \$\$C\_T = \frac{1}{2}{}^t\int\limits\_0^f

		{\sum\limits\_{i = 1}^n {\left( {\frac{{{\text{d}}z\_i }}{{{\text{d}}t}}}

		\right)^2 {\text{d}}t,} } \$\$ where ziis the torque generated by

		the i-th actuator (muslce) out of n actuators, and tfis the movement

		time. Since this objective function critically depends on the complex

		nonlinear dynamics of the musculoskeletal system, it is very difficult

		to determine the unique trajectory which yields the best performance.

		We overcome this difficult by developing an iterative scheme, with

		which the optimal trajectory and the associated motor command are

		simultaneously computed. To evaluate our model, human hand trajectories

		were experimentally measured under various behavioral situations.

		These results supported the idea that the human hand trajectory is

		planned and controlled in accordance with the minimum torquechange

		criterion.

		This chapter describes gene expression analysis by Singular Value

		Decomposition (SVD), emphasizing initial characterization of the

		data. We describe SVD methods for visualization of gene expression

		data, representation of the data using a smaller number of variables,

		and detection of patterns in noisy gene expression data. In addition,

		we describe the precise relation between SVD analysis and Principal

		Component Analysis (PCA) when PCA is calculated using the covariance

		matrix, enabling our descriptions to apply equally well to either

		method. Our aim is to provide definitions, interpretations, examples,

		and references that will serve as resources for understanding and

		extending the application of SVD and PCA to gene expression analysis.

		We introduce Gaussian process dynamical models (GPDMs) for nonlinear

		time series analysis, with applications to learning models of human

		pose and motion from high-dimensional motion capture data. A GPDM

		is a latent variable model. It comprises a low-dimensional latent

		space with associated dynamics, as well as a map from the latent

		space to an observation space. We marginalize out the model parameters

		in closed form by using Gaussian process priors for both the dynamical

		and the observation mappings. This results in a nonparametric model

		for dynamical systems that accounts for uncertainty in the model.

		We demonstrate the approach and compare four learning algorithms

		on human motion capture data, in which each pose is 50-dimensional.

		Despite the use of small data sets, the GPDM learns an effective

		representation of the nonlinear dynamics in these spaces.

We develop the notion of measure-theoretic Bayesian networks (MTBNs) and use it to provide more general semantics for PPLs with arbitrarily many random variables defined over arbitrary measure spaces. We develop two new general sampling algorithms that are provably correct under the MTBN framework: the lexicographic likelihood weighting (LLW) for general MTBNs and the lexicographic particle filter (LPF), a specialized algorithm for state-space models. We further integrate MTBNs into a widely used PPL system, BLOG, and verify the effectiveness of the new inference algorithms through representative examples.}

We assume the whole objective function is strongly convex. Such problems often arise in machine learning, known as regularized empirical risk minimization. We propose and analyze a new proximal stochastic gradient method, which uses a multi-stage scheme to progressively reduce the variance of the stochastic gradient. While each iteration of this algorithm has similar cost as the classical stochastic gradient method (or incremental gradient method), we show that the expected objective value converges to the optimum at a geometric rate. The overall complexity of this method is much lower than both the proximal full gradient method and the standard proximal stochastic gradient method. 1},

	abstract     = {We consider a generic convex optimization problem associated with regularized empirical risk minimization of linear predictors. The problem structure allows us to reformulate it as a convex-concave saddle point problem. We propose a stochastic primal-dual coordinate (SPDC) method, which alternates between maximizing over a randomly chosen dual variable and minimizing over the primal variable. An extrapolation step on the primal variable is performed to obtain accelerated convergence rate. We also develop a mini-batch version of the SPDC method which facilitates parallel computing, and an extension with weighted sampling probabilities on the dual variables, which has a better complexity than uniform sampling on unnormalized data. Both theoretically and empirically, we show that the SPDC method has comparable or better performance than several state-of-the-art optimization methods.},

The goal is to make use of the known $n$ features to reduce sample and computational complexities. We present and analyze a new gradient-based non-convex optimization algorithm that converges to the true underlying matrix at a linear rate with sample complexity only linearly depending on $n$ and logarithmically depending on $d$. To the best of our knowledge, all previous algorithms either have a quadratic dependency on the number of features in sample complexity or a sub-linear computational convergence rate. In addition, we provide experiments on both synthetic and real world data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.}
